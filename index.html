A journey that began with a plate of biriyani...<br>
And ended with me losing my heart and peace to you forever.

<h2>The Flavor of First Sight</h2>
<p>
They say love happens in mysterious ways, but for us, it was seasoned with spices.<br>
I walked into that wedding with only one mission: the food counter.<br><br>
But amidst the steam of the biriyani and the chaos of the guests,<br>
my eyes caught yours. The aroma faded, the noise died down,<br>
and suddenly, the biriyani didn't seem like the best thing in the room anymore.

<h2>A Spark in a Question</h2>
<p>
“Where did you get your tattoo?”<br><br>
It was such a simple opening, but the way you looked at me changed the air.<br>
Your confidence was magnetic; your smile was a trap I happily fell into.<br>
In that moment, 'Infinity' stopped being just a design on skin—<br>
it became the duration I wanted to spend by your side.

<h2>Digital Echoes & 3 AM Hearts</h2>
<p>
The blue glow of Instagram became our little sanctuary.<br>
What started as casual story replies turned into paragraphs of thoughts.<br><br>
“Going to sleep now” usually meant another two hours of talking.<br>
I found myself checking my phone every minute, addicted to the way<br>
you understood the parts of me I never even mentioned.

<section class="fade-section">
<h2>The Beauty of Stolen Seconds</h2>
<p>
College wasn’t about the lectures; it was about the 'side gaps.'<br>
Those hidden corners where we shared quick glances and heavy silences.<br><br>
The world saw two people walking past each other,<br>
but we felt the electricity of accidental hand touches that were entirely on purpose.<br>
Those small, stolen moments built the foundation of our forever.

<section class="fade-section">
<h2 class="gold-text">When Time Stood Still</h2>
<p>
Then came the storm. The world tried to silence us.<br>
<strong>No texts. No calls. No way to reach you.</strong><br><br>
But they underestimated our stubbornness. We had neighbors who became allies,<br>
friends who played messengers, and that legendary night where I had to<br>
<strong>hijack Grandmother’s phone</strong> just to hear your breath on the other side.<br><br>
We proved that no wall is high enough when two hearts refuse to let go.

<h2>29 August 2026 — The Vow</h2>
<p>
7:00 AM. The air was cool, the temple bells were rhythmic, and my heart was racing.<br><br>
Under the sacred witness of the morning light, the struggle ended and our life began.<br>
When I tied that knot, it wasn't just a tradition—it was a promise<br>
that I would protect your peace as fiercely as you protected our love.

<section class="fade-section">
<h2>Across Borders, Hand in Hand</h2>
<p>
From the vibrant streets of Malaysia to the golden sunsets of Bali.<br>
Exploring the world with you felt like seeing colors for the first time.<br><br>
Waking up in a foreign land and seeing your face next to mine<br>
reminded me that 'home' isn't a place with an address—it's you.

<section class="fade-section">
<h2>The Chaos We Call Home</h2>
<p>
It’s not just the grand moments; it’s the beautiful mess in between.<br>
Your random mood swings, your adorable jealousy, and that stubborn streak<br>
that I’ve secretly grown to love. <br><br>
Our endless gossip, our shared silence, and the way you know exactly<br>
what I’m thinking without me saying a word. That’s the real magic.

<section class="fade-section">
<h2 class="gold-text">To Infinity & Beyond</h2>
<p>
This isn't the end of the story; it's just the prologue.<br>
To more flights, more fights, more midnight snacks, and a million more memories.<br><br>
We started as strangers chasing biriyani,<br>
and now we are soulmates chasing the horizon.<br><br>
<strong>I love you, Ramya. Always.</strong>
